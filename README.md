# Text-Processor-For-Identification-Of-Offences
The purpose of this document is to provide a system that effectively manages and predicts the IPC sections charged on an accused. The system allows police to access and decide the IPC sections through this web application. And though by the help of this project we are going to convert the manual process by the automatic IPC sections generation according to the offences committed by the accused so it will be time saving for the police and they will simplify very complex tasks. The key notion is that flexible, automatic approaches are used to detect patterns within the text, with a primary focus on making predictions on future data.
